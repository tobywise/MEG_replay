Now that you've become familiar with the pictures, we're going to begin the task.

*You will move through the pictures in this task using the arrow keys. You'll see an image on the screen, and then it is up to you to move to another picture using what you learned about the pictures in the training.

*You will enter three movements with the arrow keys, then you will be shown which pictures you have moved through. The moves you make will be displayed as arrows on the screen as you press the arrow keys. When the third image is displayed on the screen, you will also see a monetary reward value that will be added to your total winnings.

*Remember, your goal is to find the picture with the highest reward value. This image will change frequently across trials.

*If you don't have any questions, press the spacebar to begin.
