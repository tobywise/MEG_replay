This next phase will test your knowledge of the task.

*After seeing the start and end images, you will again see a grid of possible images. However this time it will be up to you to choose the sequence of images that will get you to the end image.

As in the training, you can choose an image by pressing the number shown on top of the image. Some images have the same number, but if you are thinking of the correct image the computer will know which image to select.

It's important that you select images in the correct order.

*After selecting a sequence of images you will be shown which pictures you have moved through. When the third image is displayed on the screen, you will be shown feedback to indicate whether you were successful in getting to the correct image. If you press a sequence of keys that isn't allowed, you will be told your moves were incorrect.

*If you don't have any questions, press 1 to begin.
